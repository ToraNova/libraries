1.EOL issue on ^M
when editing a file in dos, and attempting to run it in linux
the following trouble will occur:

/usr/bin/blabla^M: bad interpreter

this indicate the EOL used is incompatible

one can call upon the program dos2unix to convert the file back to
unix compatible format

dos2unix <filename>

and subsequently launching it again
./<filename>.ext

this will solve the issue
