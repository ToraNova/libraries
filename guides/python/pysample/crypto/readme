Due to the staggering amount of cryptographic python libraries out there,
this section is managed by pipenv

please install pipenv with distro's package manager
pacman -S python-pipenv
apt install python-pipenv

randkeygen.py is not managed by pipenv and can be simply run using the
python command or ./randkeygen.py

for the files under the directories (aes/openssl etc.) use the
pipenv run python <script.py> to run them

in addition, if this is on a newly found machine, please install the
modules first with
pipenv install --dev

Files under pipenv faces difficulty installing the libraries via pip
of course one could still compile the libs from source but for sake
of guides this is overkill
