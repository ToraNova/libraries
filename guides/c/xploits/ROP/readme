ROP - Return Oriented Programming

ROP is a method used to circumvent exploit prevention strategies.
attacker uses control of stack right before the RET to direct code
into an address that is supposedly safe.

additional notes:
for x86 (32bit exploit), use the -m32 flag
gcc -m32 test.c

the gnu compiler protects against stack smashing (buffer overflows)
use the following flag to disable it
-fno-stack-protector

using the gdb to disassemble the compiled program 'a,out'

run the command : disas <function_name> to disassemble and assess a function's assembler code
