This is the template module format
use this for include more modules

Each codebase in a module should ideally consist
of 2 parts, the cpp and the hpp. both of these
are the basis for the cplusplus library.

the rest, we can extend our support to C projects
by adding a .h and a .c wrapper to "wrap" the cpp
as a c file. This way, our library will support
the two languages.
